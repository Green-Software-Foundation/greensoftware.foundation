HEADLINE: Measure What Matters: Software's Carbon Impact SUBHEADLINE: The global standard for calculating and reducing the carbon emissions of your software BODY: Every software application has a carbon footprint through the energy it consumes and the hardware it requires. The Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification provides the first ISO-accredited methodology to measure this impact as a score. Unlike carbon offsets, SCI focuses on actual emission reductions—empowering developers, architects, and organizations to make informed decisions that create real environmental change.

## **\[SECTION: WHAT\_IS\]**

**HEADING:** What is Software Carbon Intensity?

**CONTENT:** The Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification is an ISO-accredited standard (ISO/IEC 21031:2024) for measuring the carbon emissions of software applications. It provides a clear, consistent methodology that transforms complex environmental data into a single actionable score—making it possible to compare different software solutions, track improvements over time, and make evidence-based decisions about technology choices.

Unlike traditional carbon accounting that focuses on totals and offsets, SCI calculates a rate—carbon emissions per functional unit of your software, whether that's per user, per transaction, or per API call. This approach reveals the true efficiency of your software and guides you toward meaningful reductions through better code, smarter infrastructure choices, and carbon-aware computing strategies.

## **\[SECTION: WHY\_MATTERS\]**

HEADING: Why SCI Matters INTRO: Software's environmental impact is invisible but significant—and growing exponentially with AI and digital transformation.

SUBSECTION: Industry Impact Every line of code, every server, every user interaction contributes to the software's growing carbon footprint. The SCI specification makes this invisible impact visible and actionable. By providing a standardized measurement protocol, it enables the entire industry to work from the same playbook—creating transparency, driving innovation, and accelerating the transition to truly sustainable technology. Major organizations, including AVEVA, Microsoft, NTT DATA, and UBS, are already using SCI to transform how they build and deploy software.

SUBSECTION: Business Benefits \[ICON: chart\] **Drive Cost Efficiency** \- Software optimized for lower SCI scores uses less energy and hardware, directly reducing operational costs \[ICON: clock\] **Meet Sustainability Goals** \- Demonstrate measurable progress toward net-zero commitments with ISO-certified methodology \[ICON: dollar\] **Gain Competitive Advantage** \- Differentiate your products with verified sustainability credentials that customers increasingly demand \[ICON: shield\] **Future-Proof Operations** \- Stay ahead of emerging regulations and reporting requirements with established measurement practices

SUBSECTION: Environmental Impact Every point reduction in your SCI score represents real carbon that never enters the atmosphere. This isn't about purchasing offsets or making claims \- it's about fundamental changes in how software is designed, developed, and deployed. When organizations optimize for SCI, they naturally adopt practices that reduce energy consumption, extend hardware lifecycles, and shift computing to cleaner energy sources. The cumulative effect of thousands of development teams making these optimizations could prevent millions of tons of carbon emissions annually.

## **\[SECTION: HOW\_IT\_WORKS\_HIGH\_LEVEL\]**

HEADING: A New Way to Think About Software CONTENT: The SCI score combines three essential factors that determine software's carbon footprint: the energy your software consumes (E), the carbon intensity of that energy based on location and time (I), and the embodied emissions from manufacturing the hardware (M). These are calculated per functional unit (R) \- creating a rate that reveals true efficiency.

This simple equation \- SCI \= (E × I \+ M) per R \- transforms how teams approach software development. Instead of guessing at environmental impact, you can measure it. Instead of generic best practices, you have specific targets. Instead of greenwashing, you have genuine reductions.
