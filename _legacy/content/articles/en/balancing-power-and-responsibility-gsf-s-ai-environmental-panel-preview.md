Imagine AI as the superhero swooping in to save our planet from environmental threats. It's a story everyone wants to tell! 

Yet, here's the paradox: this hero may unwittingly contribute to our growing appetite for computing resources and energy. Is this an unintended adversary threatening to escalate software's carbon emissions? A look at[<u> Stanford’s Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2023</u>](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/HAI_AI-Index-Report-2023_CHAPTER_2.pdf) reveals that training GPT-3 took the equivalent of 502 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, and close to 1,300 megawatt hours of electricity.

On October 5, we will convene experts to answer the question, and explore how we can make AI greener and carbon-aware, giving it the badge of Environmental Crusader so many want.

# What is the panel discussion about?

While ethical considerations and social impact are critical dimensions to the broader responsible AI conversation, we are eager to delve deeper into the environmental impact considerations of AI, primarily the challenges and opportunities to reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption for AI. 

In this virtual event, AI Sustainability and Ethics leaders will share their experiences and insights, shedding light on:

**The current State of Green Software:** Where are we in green software, and what do the challenges and opportunities in the field signal for greener AI?

**Purposeful design:** Do certain languages and processes favour decarbonization?  

**Measuring what matters:** Are there existing tools and metrics to accurately assess the carbon emissions and energy consumption of AI systems and their components accurately?

**Multi-disciplinary approach:** How can practitioners across functional areas–like engineering, research, design and data analysis–work together to inform the C-Suite?

**You, me, and change:** Explore how individual contributors and sustainability groups can be the catalysts for a greener AI revolution.

# Which questions will be answered by the panel?

The panel will focus on prominent barriers and challenges in the journey to make AI environmentally friendly and how to collectively address them as an industry. It will address whether we can build AI solutions using tools like the Carbon Aware SDK and look at strategies to build climate-conscious applications. 

In addition to reducing carbon emissions, what other environmental goals should AI developers and organizations prioritize in relation to business interests? The panelists will touch upon initiatives and partnerships that are crucial for advancing sustainable AI, and demonstrate how organizations can get involved in these efforts.

We will uncover some critical knowledge gaps and check how far regulatory bodies and government agencies are contributing to the sustainability of AI.

Last, but not least, the panel will share their views on  the most promising technical inventions to guide attendees on where investment money should flow.

# Who are the Moderator and Speakers?

We are pleased to have recognized personalities in green software for the online event:

**Dawn Nafus**, Anthropologist and Senior Research Scientist at Intel Labs, will be your moderator.

**Chris McClean**, Global Lead for Digital Ethics at Avanade, will be speaking on topics such as risk management, compliance, and the multi-disciplinary approach within AI development.

**Dr. Elif Kiesow Cortez**, Director of Quantum & AI and Research Fellow on Tech Ethics & Governance at Stanford University. 

**Navveen Balani**, Chief Technologist at the Technology Sustainability Innovation Group at Accenture, will share his insights on the role of open source, the human factor, and how to assess opportunities in the development process.

# Ask your questions at the live Q&A

We are not just narrating this story; we're giving you a front-row seat to be part of it! Our live Q&A session lets you ask questions that matter most to you and challenge dominant ideas.


We look forward to your participation!
