The projects and initiatives we’re announcing reflect three big lessons we learned in the last 12 months:

1. Even with tools like the Carbon Aware SDK and the SCI Specification, reducing software's carbon emissions remains monumentally challenging for many organizations because many practitioners have yet to learn the skills to measure their baseline.
2. Nurturing micro-communities within organizations is an absolute imperative, and the foundation needs to play a larger role here as green software advocates need more support to build momentum internally.
3. Tools like the SCI Specification, though a big step forward in measuring the carbon emissions of software, have been difficult for many to adopt due to the complex nature of their systems.

As a result, the updates, releases, and new announcements we're sharing are set to:  

**Meet Organizations Where They Are:** We have taken a proactive approach, recognizing the diversity of organizations, building levels of engagement and spaces for knowledge sharing to meet them at their respective stages of progress, whether in measurement, learning, or adoption.

**Seek Continuous Improvement:** Build on the use cases of applying tools like the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) Specification and Carbon Aware SDK. 

**Develop New Measurement Tools:** Enhance and refine green software standards to serve enterprises large and small, while extending the use of green software tools to measure carbon emissions but also various environmental impacts associated with different types of software.

**Big Announcements:**

# Impact Engine Framework

Software has diverse environmental effects, including carbon, water, and energy usage, which need optimization. However, measuring these metrics is a challenging task. Modern applications consist of various software components operating on different platforms, some out of an organization's control. 

The [<u>Impact Engine Framework</u>](https://greensoftwarefoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~612dd45e45cd76006a84071a/pages/17072136/Opensource+Impact+Engine+Framework) is an Open Source Working Group project. The objective is to Model, Measure, siMulate and Monitor the environmental impacts of software. Modern applications are composed of many smaller pieces of software (components) running on many different environments, for example, private cloud, public cloud, bare-metal, virtualized, containerized, mobile, laptops, and desktops. Every environment requires a different measurement model, and no single solution calculates the environmental impacts for all components on all environments.

With SCI use cases beginning to take shape, software measurement is becoming a mainstream practice with industry professionals dedicated to decarbonizing software. Formalizing software measurement into a discipline with standards and tooling is crucial. While the SCI Specification serves as the standard, the Impact Engine Framework provides the necessary tooling for this endeavor.

Where does the project stand today? 

We have:

- developed a specification
- developed a proof-of-concept
- demonstrated the proof of concept at several events and shared with stakeholders
- developed documentation and comprehensive tests

We expect an Alpha version to be ready within a few short weeks.

# Real-Time Energy and Carbon Standard for Cloud Providers

Cloud providers hold a crucial position in sustainability, but we've been missing real-time carbon metrics up until now. As integral components of the information technology supply chain, cloud providers must now provide real-time carbon metrics that they can consolidate based on workloads, allocate, and distribute throughout the supply chain. This action is essential to comply with the regulations currently enforced in Europe and California and those emerging in other regions.

Our latest project, part of the [<u>Standards Working Group</u>](https://greensoftwarefoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~612dd45e45cd76006a84071a/pages/819277/Standards+Working+Group), has a clear mission: establishing a benchmark for measuring carbon emissions. This initiative marks a significant shift from the traditional practice of monthly reporting to the adoption of minute-by-minute metrics for all cloud providers. It's a pioneering step towards greater transparency and sustainability in the cloud computing industry.

# Carbon Aware SDK 1.1

The Carbon Aware SDK empowers developers to create environmentally-conscious software solutions that intelligently utilize the cleanest energy sources. The goal is to run software at the best time and in the best location, in terms of carbon emissions, or even both simultaneously! The key advantages of the Carbon Aware SDK encompass collecting consistent data, tracking emissions reduction, and facilitating well-informed decision-making.

Version 1.1 launched earlier this year to support ElectricityMaps as a fresh data source, offering paid and free APIs. This update also enhances the overall usability and stability of the Carbon Aware SDK. It provides a library for DLL import usage for seamless integration into your projects without deploying an API.

The project will be undergoing review to achieve a [<u>Graduated status</u>](https://oc.greensoftware.foundation/project-lifecycle.html) under GSF.

# Software Carbon Efficiency Rating (SCER)

The SCER aims to provide consumers and organizations with a clear and consumer-friendly benchmark for assessing the environmental impact of software to make pro-planet choices when selecting digital products. 

The goal is to provide comparable ratings for software with similar functionalities. This involves defining standard workloads for different types of software, categorizing them, and setting standards based on the functional unit of the [<u>Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) Specification</u>](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/sci/tree/dev). Hardware standards for testing these workloads and the boundaries of the software under test are also part of the process.

For consumers, SCER is a vital tool to gauge the carbon intensity of applications. For businesses, SCER is a powerful procurement tool, enabling teams to make sustainable choices when contracting services or purchasing software, having a positive return on operational efficiency and emissions reduction. 

The project is advancing with creating a test platform that assesses energy consumption levels for various software configurations. The next phase involves establishing parameters for software categories, such as databases, to make them comparable. The ultimate challenge is to provide clear guidelines for informed decision-making, all while considering the complexities of modern software architectures.
