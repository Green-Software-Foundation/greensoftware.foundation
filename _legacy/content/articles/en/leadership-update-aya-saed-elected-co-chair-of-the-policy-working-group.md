We’re thrilled to announce a new leadership position within the Green Software Foundation: Aya Saed, Director of AI Policy and Strategy at Scope3, has been elected co-chair of our Policy Working Group (PWG). Aya joins Chris Adams, Director of Technology and Policy at the Green Web Foundation, to advance our mission of aligning global policy, practice, and green software development.

The Working Group engages with existing and emerging policies that impact green software and proposes its own policy drafts.

“There is still a critical gap between recognizing the challenges related to the physical impact of technologies and having practical solutions that balance economic growth with efficiency and sustainability,” said Aya. “And this is where the PWG steps in—not through lobbying, but through convening, clarifying, and educating relevant stakeholders on the real impact of our technological reality.”  

# **Introducing the New Co-Chair **

Aya brings deep experience across the public and private sectors. As Counsel and Legislative Director in the U.S. House of Representatives, she developed a strong understanding of the challenges global policymakers face. 

“Drawing from my experience with Congress, I've seen firsthand how decision-makers struggle to navigate this (digital technology) territory without comprehensive, technically grounded frameworks,” explains Aya. 

At Scope3, she applies that insight to the real-world challenges of advancing green software practices. The company measures emissions and resource intensity across digital supply chains, from advertising to AI, helping organizations grow safely and sustainably.

“What has been crucial to me is seeing how this data is used,” she adds. “We go beyond measurement to provide partners with both the data and tools to identify waste, track efficiencies, and drive meaningful improvements. Translating complex technical realities into clear, actionable insights for decision-makers is exactly what I hope to bring to the PWG. With the same rigor and clarity applied to policy frameworks, we can help stakeholders understand not just the challenges of digital sustainability but the practical pathways to addressing them.”

# **Building on Our Values and Looking Ahead **

As PWG Co-Chair, Aya will lead efforts to deliver actionable guidelines for policymakers, institutions, and technology leaders. Through evidence-based resources and measurable standards, we aim to advance sustainability while promoting transparency, accountability, and consistency.

“One of the biggest challenges is the fragmentation of the policy landscape,” Aya notes. There’s no centralized authority setting energy standards for software, and existing regulatory frameworks often lag far behind the pace of digital innovation. But that’s also where the opportunity lies: to influence upstream decisions—procurement, design, infrastructure—that shape emissions before they ever occur.”

She emphasizes the importance of proactive engagement to ensure current digital defaults don’t become new norms.

“My goal is to help make this Working Group the connective tissue between technical expertise and policy action, so that sustainability becomes a core part of how digital systems are designed, deployed, and governed.”
