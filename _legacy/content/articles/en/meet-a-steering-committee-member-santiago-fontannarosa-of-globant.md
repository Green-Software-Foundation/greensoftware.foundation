## Tell us about your  career path, interest in green software and your journey to the Green Software Foundation

 I have been passionate about technology for as long as I can remember. I pursued a degree in Computer Science, and from there I started working on software engineering, along different paths (sysadmin, web development, mobile, etc.). But I am always fascinated by how technology can help us move forward and improve everyone's well being. 

Along that path, a couple of years back—and already being part of Globant—I came across the concept of "Digital Sustainability", which in a nutshell implies applying technology to achieve sustainable goals. Since that moment it became my personal and professional goal to develop and continue growing in that direction. So, joining the Green Software Foundation (GSF) was the right step forward for me and also for Globant.

## What do you, as an individual, expect to achieve by working with the GSF and in green software?

I believe that we all need to become aware of the impact software has on the environment and that with small changes we can achieve a huge impact. Joining the GSF for me, means to continue exploring how through technology we can address one of the biggest problems of the modern era and make a mark on the world, for our generation and for future generations to come.

## What obstacles do you see to the cause of green software? How can we overcome them? 

There are many challenges as we move forward. Since technology evolves very quickly, we as an organization will be forced to adapt to keep the pace. 

For the time being, I believe two of the most important challenges we need to address now, are to get the software community to agree on a common corpus—terms, methodology, best practices, etc—and to develop the tools and practices that give teams the ability to measure energy impact of software and allow them to act on the findings. 

In the future, for sure, new challenges may arise. But we will take them on as we move forward. 

## Any other thoughts you would like to share with us on the cause of green software?

I just want to highlight what a great initiative the GSF is, and I hope that we continue growing and gaining traction so more organizations, individuals and maybe—in the future—governments will want to join.
