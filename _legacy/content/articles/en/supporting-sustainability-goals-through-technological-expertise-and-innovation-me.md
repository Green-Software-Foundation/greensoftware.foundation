## Can you tell us about Almaviva?

Almaviva is a leading Italian ICT Group. Through consultancy, process and service re-engineering, and usability design, it has supported companies and public administrations facing the challenges of staying competitive in the digital era. 

The Group has a global network of 30 companies and 79 branches, 44 in Italy and 35 worldwide, and employs 45,000 people worldwide. 

We are committed to improving people’s lives, putting the potential of technology at the service of the community, and driving the transformation responsibly towards a better future for all.

## How does environmental sustainability fit into your organization?

Almaviva has integrated sustainability as a pivotal element of its corporate strategies while recognizing the importance of technological progress that is attentive to environmental implications. 

As an organization, we strive to measure and reduce the environmental impact of our IT operations, with a strong focus on energy consumption and carbon emissions. 

In addition to promoting environmental responsibility internally through various projects and initiatives, we use the potential of technological solutions to drive sustainable growth in the countries in which we operate. 

Through initiatives such as the Giotto Digital Ecosystem, which operates in the cloud and cybersecurity, Almaviva enables the development of scalable, sustainable IT solutions that promote resource optimization and energy efficiency. The Giotto Ecosystem's recent addition, The Insight Hub, complements its function by supporting Clean Tech and Green Cloud innovations across the whole software lifecycle.

## Are there any other sustainability initiatives that you can share?

Together with the Foundation for Digital Sustainability, we actively participate in the development and implementation phases of UNI PdR 147, the first European reference standard focusing on digital sustainability in innovation processes. 

The initiative integrates sustainability principles into project life cycles using 58 KPIs linked to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## Why did Almaviva join the GSF?

Joining the GSF underpins our key objective of supporting the sustainability goals of our customers through technological expertise and innovative products and services.  

This commitment is reflected in our concept of “absolute digital.” For Almaviva, this means going beyond the purely technological aspect to promote and increase understanding of the impact digital technologies have on people, organizations, and the environment.

As our values align with the principles expressed in the GSF Manifesto, we envision a shared path to enable fairer and more sustainable technological progress.
