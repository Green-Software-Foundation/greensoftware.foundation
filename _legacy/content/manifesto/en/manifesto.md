mainParagraph: "The Green Software Foundation’s Manifesto is the public facing declaration of the policy and aims of the Foundation.

    operationalise: "* We will ensure digital accessibility throughout our organizational processes, communications channels, standard development, and code.\n* Our working groups and steering committee will work via consensus. If we fail to reach a consensus on issues, then there is a vote. The organization's size does not matter. Each general and steering member organization has one vote each.\n* Our steering committee will review any requests for resources that, on balance, benefit some member organizations over others.\n* We will follow the Linux Foundation [anti-trust policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/)."
