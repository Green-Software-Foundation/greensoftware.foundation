We may also collect information relating to your participation in technical, governance or other Project-related meetings.

Your contributions to Open Source Projects, and certain of your other Content such as comments and messages posted to public forums, are available to other participants and users of our Projects and of our Services, and may be viewed publicly. In some cases you may be able to provide Project or contribution-related information directly to third-party sites and services; these third parties are independent data controllers and their use of your personal information is subject to their own policies.
- Service Providers*. *We may share your information with third party service providers who use this information to perform services for us, such as payment processors, hosting providers, auditors, advisors, contractors and consultants. In addition, The Linux Foundation performs services for JDFP as a managed services provider with regards to Projects. In such cases, JDFP may share with The Linux Foundation the same types of data as described above, doing so in the furtherance of performing services for those Projects.

- Anonymized and Aggregated Data*. *We may share aggregate or de-identified information with third parties for research, marketing, analytics and other purposes, provided such information does not identify a particular individual.

**Cookies, Tracking, and Interest-Based Ads**

We and our third-party providers use cookies, clear GIFs/pixel tags, JavaScript, local storage, log files, and other mechanisms to automatically collect and record information about your usage and browsing activities on our Site and across third party sites or online services. We may combine this information with other information we collect about Users. Below, we provide a brief summary these activities. For more detailed information about these mechanisms and how we collect activity information, see our Cookie Policy.

- ***Cookies*** *. *These are small files with a unique identifier that are transferred to your browser through our websites. They allow us to remember Users who are logged in, to understand how Users navigate through and use the Sites, and to display personalized content and targeted ads (including on third party sites and applications).
- ***Pixels, web beacons, clear GIFs*** *. *These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which we track browsing activities. We use these as part of our Training Affiliate Program. We also use these in our emails to let us know when they have been opened or forwarded, so we can gauge the effectiveness of our communications.
- ***Analytics Tools*** *. *We may use internal and third-party analytics tools, including [Google Analytics ](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en). The third-party analytics companies we work with may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online products and services. Their collection and use of information is subject to their own privacy policies.

Please note that JDFP does not respond to "do not track" signals or other similar mechanisms intended to allow California residents to opt-out of Internet tracking under California Online Privacy Protection Action ("CalOPPA").

***Targeted Ads.*** As discussed in our Cookie Policy, we may work with third party advertisers to display more relevant ads on our website and on third party sites; these third parties may display ads to you based on your visit to our Sites and other third party sites. For more information about this and how you can opt out of such ads, please see our Cookie Policy.

**Data Security**

We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your passwords, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing robust passwords that nobody else knows or can easily guess, not using a password for more than one site or service, and keeping your log-ins and passwords private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity. You must promptly notify us if you become aware that any information provided by or submitted to our Sites or through our Services is lost, stolen, or used without permission at privacy@jdfprojects.org.

**Marketing Choices**

You may opt out or revoke your consent to receive marketing emails from us by using unsubscribe or opt out mechanisms included in our marketing emails or by emailing privacy@jdfprojects.org. You may unsubscribe from mailing lists via the applicable mailing list's subscription website or, in some cases, by using the unsubscribe mechanisms included in such emails.

**Retention of Your Personal Data**

We apply a general rule of keeping personal data only for as long as required to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected. However, in some circumstances, we may retain personal data for other periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements, or if required to do so by a legal process, legal authority, or other governmental entity having authority to make the request, for so long as required. In specific circumstances, we may also retain your personal data for longer periods of time corresponding to a statute of limitation, so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges.

**International Transfers**

If you are located within the European Union (EU), you should note that your information will be transferred to the United States where JDFP is located. The U.S. is deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data protection. However, we have put in place European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses which protect personal data transferred between JDFP and affiliated entities as well as The Linux Foundation, its managed service provider. In addition, if personal data is transferred to third party service providers located outside the European Union, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EU, including by entering into data transfer agreements, or using the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses. You have a right to obtain details of the mechanism under which your personal data is transferred outside of the EU by contacting gdpr@jdfprojects.org.

**Children's Privacy**

Except as specifically indicated within a Site, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 (or under the age of 14 for anyone living in Spain or South Korea), or knowingly allow such persons to register. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the relevant age without parental consent, we take steps to delete that information.

**Links to Third Party Sites and Services**

The Sites may contain links to third party sites or online services. We are not responsible for the practices of such third parties, whose information practices are subject to their own policies and procedures, not to this Privacy Policy.

**Your Rights**

***Access and Amendment*** *. *You may contact our privacy coordinator, as set forth below, to access or amend your personal information.

***Additional Rights*** *. *Individuals in the European Economic Area (and other jurisdictions where applicable) have additional rights under applicable law:

- to obtain a copy of your personal data together with information about how and on what basis that personal data is processed;
- to rectify inaccurate personal data (including to have incomplete personal data completed);
- to erase your personal data (in limited circumstances, such as where it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or processed);
- to restrict processing of your personal data under certain circumstances;
- to export certain personal data in machine-readable format to a third party (or to you) when we justify our processing on the basis of your consent or the performance of a contract with you;
- to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data (where that processing is based on your consent);
- to obtain, or see a copy of the appropriate safeguards under which your personal data is transferred to a third country or international organization; and

We will endeavor to respond to your request within all applicable timeframes.

**California Privacy Rights**

California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the types of personal information disclosed to those parties.

<u>**Cookie Policy of JDF Projects**</u>

*Effective date* : May 5, 2020

The websites of Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC and its projects (collectively, the "Sites") use cookies, in combination with pixels, local storage objects, and similar devices (collectively, "cookies" unless otherwise noted) to distinguish you from other users of the Sites. This helps us provide you with a good experience, improve our service, and personalize ads and content that may be delivered to you while you use the Sites.

This cookie policy ("Cookie Policy") describes the types of the cookies we use on the Sites and our purposes for using them.

If you have questions about this Cookie Policy, please contact us at privacy@jdfprojects.org. For a more complete description of the third party cookies that we currently use on the Sites, please see below. For more information about our privacy practices, please review our Privacy Policy. We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time, so please check back periodically.

**Your Consent**

You consent to placement of cookies on your computer by us and our third party service providers. Please read this Cookie Policy carefully for details about why we use cookies and the information they collect from and about you.

**Withdraw Your Consent at Any Time**

If you do not wish to accept cookies in connection with your use of the Sites, you will need to delete, and block or disable cookies via your browser settings; see below for more information on how to do this. Please note that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of the Sites, and may prevent you from being able to access certain features on the Sites.

**What Is a Cookie?**

A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon as you visit the Sites.

**Key Concepts**

***First and third-party cookies*** : whether a cookie is 'first' or 'third' party refers to the domain placing the cookie.

- *First-party cookies* are those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time (e.g., cookies placed by org).
- *Third-party cookies* are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party cookie.

***Persistent cookies*** : these cookies remain on a user's device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.

***Session cookies*** : these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.

**How to Delete and Block our Cookies**

Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies), you may not be able to access all or parts of the Sites. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon as you visit the Sites.

***Changing your Cookie Settings. ***The browser settings for changing your cookies settings are usually found in the 'options' or 'preferences' menu of your internet browser. In order to understand these settings, the following links may be helpful. Otherwise you should use the 'Help' option in your internet browser for more details.
