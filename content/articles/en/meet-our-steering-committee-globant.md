[<u>Globant</u>](https://www.globant.com/) is a digitally native company that helps organizations reinvent themselves with sustainability at the core and unleash their potential. We are the place where innovation, design and engineering meet scale. 

We have more than 20,000 employees and we are present in 18 countries working for companies like Google, Rockwell Automation, Electronic Arts and Santander, among others.

We were named a Worldwide Leader in CX Improvement Services by IDC MarketScape report.

We were also featured as a business case study at Harvard, MIT, and Stanford.  

## **What does Globant plan to achieve together with the GSF, for your business and for the world?**

Our main purpose is to work to make the world a better place, one step at a time. We thrive by reinventing businesses and transforming organizations to be ready for a digital and cognitive future, providing world-class opportunities for talent to make a positive impact around the globe.

At Globant, we believe that climate change impacts people and organizations in a very significant way. We also acknowledge the impact technology has on the environment, and we work on a daily basis to mitigate it by enforcing our commitment to sustainable software development practices and measures not only internally, but also with our clients. 

Now, as members of the Green Software Foundation, we reinforce our Be Kind initiative that encourages a sustainable way of living that positively impacts society, the environment, the economy and the cultural good of humanity.

One of our Be Kind Pillars is focused on the Planet, we name it Be Kind to the Planet. With this initiative we have been setting goals such as creating a Net Zero Roadmap that started in 2020 when we started operating with 100% renewable electricity resources and following with the goal we have this year of becoming completely carbon neutral, this partnership with GSF will help us achieve this and many other future objectives with the best tools and practices.

## **How does Globant see the future of green software? **

At Globant, we see the future of green software as a necessary evolution towards the way in which we are building a new development paradigm. Returning to our principles and taking care of each resource that we use, we seek that our software is as performant as possible without falling into the abuse of the resources that we have at hand today but that if we misuse it we can harm our planet.

Green software engineering is a key discipline to transform technology tools into energy-efficient vectors and to save energy. Ultimately the bottom  line is to reduce emissions. We should  all stay tuned to see how the fast-moving tech sector evolves in the immediate future and how technology is enabling organizations to better measure and reduce their environmental footprints.

## **What challenges can get in the way of progress?**

One of the challenges that we face is to become aware that poorly written and badly performing code can push us to misuse resources that are not necessarily required, but that in our desire to provide a good user experience we resort to them and, therefore we should revisit our previous steps to see how to improve that code so as not to misuse them.
