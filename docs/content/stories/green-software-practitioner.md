**Organisations:** Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Accenture, Thoughtworks, GitHub, HCLTech, Avanade, Manchester Metropolitan University, EPAM

### The Problem

Organisations had sustainability mandates from the board, net-zero commitments in their annual reports, and growing regulatory pressure from directives like CSRD. But when their engineering teams sat down at their keyboards, they had no specialised training in how software choices affect carbon emissions. Engineers couldn't distinguish genuine emissions reduction from well-intentioned guesswork.

At Goldman Sachs, Sarah Hsu saw the parallel clearly through her Site Reliability Engineering lens: "Sustainability and reliability are different concepts but are closely related and should go hand in hand with one another. We can think of sustainability as reliability over time." But there was no curriculum to teach this. At Avanade, Chris Lloyd-Jones wanted to "deliver all client projects at Avanade using green software engineering practices" and "be recognized as a responsible business, committed to sustainability and green software" -- but with 60,000 employees, where do you begin? At HCLTech, Sunil Aggarwal saw three fundamental challenges: "Lack of awareness and understanding of green software," "Lack of standards and metrics," and "Lack of tools and frameworks."

The problem wasn't motivation. The younger generation of engineers, as Sarah Hsu observed, "cares deeply about sustainability and it affects their decision-making." The problem was that no shared language, no common curriculum, and no recognised certification existed for green software engineering. Every company was starting from zero, independently.

### The Journey

The Green Software Practitioner (GSP) course was built as a collaboration between Microsoft, Accenture, Thoughtworks, and GitHub -- founding members who pooled their expertise to create what no single company could build alone. The course covered the core competencies: energy efficiency, carbon awareness, hardware efficiency, and measurement. It was released as open-source training through the Linux Foundation.

The adoption cascade began almost immediately. By the time of Decarbonize Software 2023, Asim Hussain could report that the course had "successfully trained over 50,000 participants in less than a year." That number would more than double.

At Goldman Sachs, Sarah Hsu became the internal champion. "Adopting greener software practices at Goldman Sachs has been a journey that we took on as a collective," she wrote. "We have received strong support from the firm and built a community of like-minded engineers and sponsors." Goldman Sachs hosted a GSF summit in their London office and made green software education a key focus for 2022, planning "various events where engineers can learn more about the green software movement." Sarah went further, chairing the project to revise and extend the Principles of Green Software Engineering to reflect what the field had learnt since 2019. Her ambition was clear: "I would like to see green software engineering become an integral part of the educational curriculum for anyone learning to code."

At Avanade, the story is one of grassroots persistence. Chris Lloyd-Jones started by training people on green software principles -- this was before the GSF's Practitioner Course even existed. He trained 3,200 employees to ensure "folks across the organization had a basic understanding of green software and that everyone was speaking the same language." His team set up special interest groups, Lean Coffee monthly sessions, and a Sustainability Flipboard for sharing news.

The initial engaged group was just 20-30 people in a company of 60,000. "To get everyone else involved seemed like a daunting task," Chris admitted. The tipping point came with the GSF Global Summit in June 2022, which Avanade co-sponsored. Chris leveraged the event by engaging developers, engineers, and architects at corporate locations in Sydney, London, Houston, and beyond. "After running the local sessions, we shared all the recordings... At that point, I noticed a lot more interest."

The momentum proved itself when the GSF launched the State of Green Software Survey: "Avanade had about 900 people contribute to it." In July 2023, Avanade added dedicated sustainability teams with sustainable IT as one of three sustainability pillars. Local activity groups started popping up independently -- "France has the Gallia Green Week, which organizes their own green IT webinars, for example." By late 2023, close to 1,000 employees had the practitioner certification, and 104 were actively contributing to GSF working groups. Chris's philosophy had been vindicated: "Consistent messaging and empowering our people with information and resources has made all the difference."

What made Chris's journey distinctive was its origin. He came from a background in environmental law, had pivoted to technology, and first started thinking about software's environmental impact during COVID-19 lockdowns. "We stumbled upon sustainability while seeking efficiency," he reflected. "Now, seeing the rise of sustainably powered cloud computing from hyper-scalers and regional players, sustainability as a measurement is here to stay and is no longer a serendipitous byproduct of other priorities."

At HCLTech, the scale was staggering. Sunil Aggarwal reported that "HCLTech has also launched a sustainability school where around 100k employees are getting training on sustainability guidelines." The team formed a Sustainability Centre of Excellence with "more than one hundred engineers trained in green engineering guidelines" and over fifty engineers completing training on Microsoft Sustainability Manager. They developed "30+ products and solutions around sustainability" and set up a Green Software Engineering Lab in Redmond, Washington to test Windows apps, mobile apps, and cloud services using GSF guidelines. Their team was "fully aligned with the Green Software Foundation Practitioner Course."

At EPAM, Chris Howard integrated the GSP into their learning platforms, formed a working group to review and adapt GSF practices, and aligned these with existing delivery processes. Crucially, he noted that "clients have become far more engaged in understanding the level of engineers who have completed the GSP training" -- highlighting "a growing revenue stream attached to green software."

The final piece of the story is the move into formal education. At Manchester Metropolitan University, Dr. Michael Bane delivered the inaugural "Green Software Engineering" course to undergraduate students -- the first of its kind. Together with Dr. Ernest Edifor, they set out to "advance the teaching of green software engineering across universities and colleges in the UK." Their vision: "the software developers of tomorrow, who are being trained today, acquire the knowledge, skill, and expertise to develop energy and carbon-efficient software applications." They joined the GSF to collaborate on "pedagogical approaches and the development of a green software toolkit to empower tutors across education institutions."
