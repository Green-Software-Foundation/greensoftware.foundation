## Story: "The biggest companies in the world were independently solving the same problem"

**Who came together:**
- Jeff Sandquist, Corporate Vice President, Developer Relations, Microsoft -- built the first green software team at Microsoft and co-conceived the foundation
- Sanjay Podder, Managing Director and Global Lead for Technology Sustainability Innovation, Accenture -- wrote "How Green is Your Software?" for HBR, first GSF Chair
- Erica Brescia, Chief Operating Officer, GitHub -- brought the open source community perspective and vision for "green developers by default"
- Elise Zelechowski, VP of Social Change, Thoughtworks -- brought the consultancy's climate change and shared action perspective
- Gadhu Sundaram, Vice President of Application Services, NTT DATA UK -- current GSF Chair (elected January 2025), bringing three decades of technology delivery and a deep connection to sustainability from growing up in one of the world's top ten biodiversity hotspots

**Organisations (founders):** Microsoft, Accenture, Thoughtworks, GitHub, Goldman Sachs
**Organisations (current steering):** Accenture, Cisco, Google, NTT DATA, Siemens, UBS

### The Problem

In 2020, multiple organisations were independently trying to figure out how to reduce software's environmental impact. At Microsoft, Jeff Sandquist's Developer Relations team had launched a dedicated green software team and discovered "a deep lack of knowledge specifically regarding software and sustainability." They published the Principles of Sustainable Software Engineering on Microsoft Learn -- the first comprehensive training -- and it immediately "facilitated the conversations because suddenly you could give somebody a quick half an hour training and then everybody in that room could be on the same page."

At Accenture, Sanjay Podder had spent years driving innovation at the intersection of sustainability and technology. He had founded the Tech4Good programme, been selected as an Eisenhower Fellow, and was researching how to decarbonise digital technologies. In 2020, he published "How Green is Your Software?" in the Harvard Business Review. As he recalled: "Early in 2021, as I was researching the green software development space, I came across some work from Jeff Sandquist and his team at Microsoft. We connected and quickly realised that we were both asking the same question; trying to solve the same problems."

At GitHub, Erica Brescia was seeing the same challenge from the open source angle: "The reality is, every line of code impacts our planet, and a carbon-negative future depends on building carbon-consciousness into software development workflows from the first line of code until decommissioning."

At Thoughtworks, the technology consultancy saw the problem from their clients' perspective: "Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges faced by humanity and the tech sector contributes a rapidly escalating amount of emissions." They believed "issues like climate change can only be resolved through global solidarity, with businesses, government and individuals working together to affect change."

The common thread across all these organisations was clear: there were no commonly agreed standards, practices, metrics, or tools to measure and minimise software-related carbon emissions. Each company was building its own approach in isolation. As Accenture's steering committee statement put it: "One critical challenge in developing green software is that there are no commonly agreed standards, practices, metrics and tools to measure and minimize software related carbon emissions. It will need new skills, new tools and new standards as well as a collaborative effort from business, academia, regulators, and non-profit organizations."

### The Journey

**2019-2020: Parallel efforts converge.** Microsoft launched its green software team within Developer Relations and published the Principles of Sustainable Software Engineering. Accenture's Sanjay Podder published "How Green is Your Software?" in Harvard Business Review. Thoughtworks, GitHub, and Goldman Sachs were all exploring the same space. As Jeff Sandquist recalled: "It turned out that a number of other organizations were also looking at the same space. First off Accenture reached out, then Thoughtworks and then our partners at GitHub. We were all talking about the same space." Non-profits like the Green Web Foundation, Leaders for Climate Action, and WattTime were also converging on the same questions.

**2021: The Green Software Foundation is founded.** The five founding organisations -- Microsoft, Accenture, Thoughtworks, GitHub, and Goldman Sachs -- established GSF as a 501(c)(6) non-profit under the Linux Foundation. The structure was deliberately egalitarian. As Jeff Sandquist explained: "One thing that is really important to us in terms of how this foundation functions is equality. That's why the Foundation is run via consensus. Our first attempt is to get everybody around the table to agree on the same subject. If we fail to achieve that, then there's a vote. But every organization gets just one vote. So, whether you're a nonprofit with ten people or an organization the size of Microsoft with 100,000 people, we all carry an equal voice."

Three working groups were established to address the three core gaps: **Standards** (what do we measure?), **Community** (who builds and adopts?), and **Innovation/Tooling** (how do we make it easy?). Microsoft's commitment was rooted in Satya Nadella's 2019 sustainability pledge and its target to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030. As Jeff Sandquist noted: "Reduction is incredibly hard, but it's what we need to achieve."

**September 2021: NTT DATA joins as a steering member.** The Japanese IT services giant became one of the first non-founding steering members, bringing a global perspective spanning Japan, Germany, the UK, and Italy.

**2021-2022: Rapid growth and first outputs.** The foundation grew quickly. The SCI specification development began. The Carbon Aware SDK was conceived. The Green Software Practitioner course was built. CarbonHack22 attracted 395 participants. By the end of 2022, GSF had grown to 38 member organisations.

**April 2022: UBS joins as a steering member.** The Swiss financial giant brought the enterprise adoption perspective, eventually deploying carbon-aware computing on production banking platforms and co-leading the Real Time Cloud standard.

**June 2023: Google joins as a steering member.** The search and cloud giant added platform-scale expertise to the foundation.

**September 2023: Siemens joins as a steering member.** The industrial technology company brought the manufacturing and automation perspective.

**April 2024: SCI achieves ISO standard status.** The SCI specification became ISO 21031:2024 -- the first ISO standard for measuring software carbon intensity. As Sanjay Podder said: "Reaching this milestone represents a collective effort from GSF member organizations. This achievement unlocks the potential to achieve industry-wide adoption of the SCI Specification, which is crucial in empowering organizations to achieve real-world emissions reductions."

**January 2025: Leadership transition to Gadhu Sundaram.** NTT DATA's Gadhu Sundaram was elected Chair, succeeding Sanjay Podder. The transition signalled a shift from creation to global adoption. Gadhu brought three decades of technology delivery experience and a deeply personal connection to sustainability: "I had the privilege of growing up in one of the world's top ten biodiversity hotspots, the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, which is home to a rich array of wildlife. My community has lived in harmony with nature for thousands of years, embodying a sustainable way of life. Some of my fondest childhood memories are of exploring the woods and encountering incredible wildlife -- I saw my first leopard at the age of six."

Sanjay Podder, stepping down after a year as Chair, reflected: "I have been proud to watch the Green Software Foundation hit several important milestones in the past year, including ISO standards for Software Carbon Intensity measurement and establishing a committee to focus on Green AI standards and practices. We've made real progress towards a more sustainable future." He continued as a member of the Green AI Committee.

**February 2025: Cisco joins as a steering member.** The networking giant brought data centre architecture and hardware sustainability expertise, and Christopher Liljenstolpe was appointed to chair the new Hardware Standards Working Group.

**2025: The foundation matures.** Gadhu outlined priorities: scaling SCI adoption through domain-specific standards (SCI for AI was ratified, SCI for Web entered development), introducing accreditation and certification programmes, releasing additional educational offerings, welcoming new members from the SSIA, and launching new working groups. As he described the virtuous cycle: "The NTT DATA's commitment to becoming sustainable by design across its entire portfolio creates a dynamic ecosystem where challenges can be brought back to GSF to shape standards, while simultaneously allowing us to adopt and apply those standards to address real-world challenges."
