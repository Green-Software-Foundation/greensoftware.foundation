### The Problem

In 2024, it became clear that many technology and sustainability professionals across GSF's membership were facing the same challenge: they couldn't keep up with new environmental legislation. With limited visibility into forthcoming regulations, there was a real risk of missing opportunities to participate in consultations, adapt internal practices, and align with emerging policies on software sustainability and emissions reporting.

The gap was specific. While GSF members and industry experts already offered guidance on existing regulations and their implementation, there was far less visibility into *developing* legislation and policies -- the bills being drafted, the consultations being opened, the deadlines approaching. By the time organisations heard about a new regulation, the consultation period was often over and they had no voice in shaping it. As Aya Saed put it: "There is still a critical gap between recognizing the challenges related to the physical impact of technologies and having practical solutions that balance economic growth with efficiency and sustainability."

The problem was compounded by fragmentation. As Aya noted: "One of the biggest challenges is the fragmentation of the policy landscape. There's no centralized authority setting energy standards for software, and existing regulatory frameworks often lag far behind the pace of digital innovation." Member organisations were each trying to track policy developments independently, duplicating effort and missing critical windows for engagement.

### The Journey

**March 2024: Chris Adams proposes the Policy Radar.** Chris Adams, Director of Technology and Policy at the Green Web Foundation, proposed building a shared, transparent view of the evolving policy landscape. The concept was straightforward: a collaborative public calendar of upcoming policy events and opportunities, where members could track what was coming and coordinate responses. The Green Web Foundation, already active in both GSF and the W3C community, was uniquely positioned to bridge the technical standards world and the policy world.

**2024: The Policy Working Group takes shape.** The Working Group began engaging with existing and emerging policies that impact green software, while also drafting its own policy proposals. The group's first major output was coordinating GSF's endorsement of the AI Environmental Impacts Act in March 2024. The Act recognised that AI computational operations were doubling every 10 months, that generating a single AI image consumes 1.35 kWh of energy, and that AI energy use could reach 85-134 terawatt hours annually by 2027 -- as much as the Netherlands consumes. GSF's endorsement called for mandated studies on AI's environmental impacts, an AI Environmental Impacts Consortium, and a voluntary reporting framework for AI developers.

**May 2025: The Policy Radar is ratified.** The database went live at policy-radar.greensoftware.foundation, providing an overview of upcoming policy events -- open consultations, new active and passed laws -- covering affected territories, relevant areas in green software, deadlines, ways to get involved, and how regulations may affect specific groups. As the ratification announcement stated: "Knowing which laws are coming and when to engage in the policy making process is half of the battle, and this project helps members address environmental impacts proactively, with integrity, and to ensure compliance with evolving standards."

**June 2025: Aya Saed elected co-chair.** Aya brought deep experience across public and private sectors. As Counsel and Legislative Director in the U.S. House of Representatives, she had seen firsthand how policymakers struggle to navigate digital technology without comprehensive, technically grounded frameworks. At Scope3, she applied that insight to measuring emissions and resource intensity across digital supply chains, from advertising to AI. Her election signalled the Policy Working Group's maturation from a tracking tool to a genuine bridge between technical expertise and policy action.

**August 2025: The PWG defines its mission.** The group published a refined mission statement, establishing five core principles -- legitimacy, opportunity, consistency, transparency, and accountability -- aligned with the UN Global Compact Guide for Responsible Corporate Engagement in Climate Policy. Critically, the PWG defined what it would *not* do: it would not endorse specific legislation or candidates, engage in lobbying as a primary activity, or advocate for partisan political positions. Instead, it positioned itself as a nonpartisan resource that converts complex research into clear frameworks and facilitates evidence-based dialogue.

**2025-2026: Proactive policy engagement accelerates.** The Policy Working Group moved from tracking to active participation:
- Coordinating responses to the **New York Senate's Corporate Climate Accountability Act**
- Engaging with the **European Green Digital Coalition**
- Tracking **state-level AI regulations across the US**
- Submitting a formal response to the **GHG Protocol Scope 2 consultation** (deadline extended to January 31, 2026), advocating for time- and location-sensitive emissions data that enables carbon-aware computing
- The GHG Protocol submission drew directly on GSF's experience developing the SCI standard, arguing that current Scope 2 guidance relying on annual averages and broad geographic boundaries doesn't provide the granularity software engineers need. GSF's position: Scope 2 should clarify emissions from generation physically connected to the reporter's value chain.

### The Impact

- **Policy Radar ratified** as a shared, transparent tool tracking forthcoming legislation across multiple territories
- **AI Environmental Impacts Act endorsed** -- GSF's first formal policy endorsement, supporting mandatory studies on AI's environmental impact
- **GHG Protocol Scope 2 consultation** -- formal submission advocating for granular, time- and location-sensitive emissions data
- **NY Corporate Climate Accountability Act** -- coordinated member response to state-level legislation
- **European Green Digital Coalition** -- engagement with EU-level digital sustainability policy
- **US state-level AI regulation tracking** -- systematic monitoring across jurisdictions
- Members now have early visibility into upcoming regulations, with a low barrier to entry for submitting new policy events (anyone can suggest; moderation ensures relevance)
