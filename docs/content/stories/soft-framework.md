## Story: "Our pilots work but nothing scales across the org"

**Who came together:**
- Pindy Bhullar, Technology Sustainability Consultant (formerly ESG Technology and Sustainable IT Lead at HSBC/UBS), ClimateAction.tech -- project lead who identified the scaling gap and co-chaired SOFT development
- Sean O'Keefe, Microsoft -- co-chair who brought Microsoft's organisational transformation experience
- Natalie Pullin, CTO Head of Sustainability, HSBC Technology -- led the effort to embed sustainability by design into technology practices at HSBC
- Tim Smolcic, Director of Tech Strategy, HSBC -- brought regulatory and governance perspective from COP28 and UN/ITU Green Digital Action working group
- Gadhu Sundaram, VP of Application Service, NTT DATA UK -- demonstrated how collaborative efforts scale green software tools across global clients

**Organisations:** HSBC, Microsoft, Avanade, BCG X, Cisco, NTT DATA, Siemens, UBS

### The Problem

By 2023, the Green Software Foundation had built an impressive toolkit: the SCI specification for measuring software carbon intensity, the Carbon Aware SDK for shifting workloads to cleaner energy, Impact Framework for standardised measurement, and Green Software Patterns for code-level guidance. Organisations had the instruments. What they lacked was a way to use them systematically across an entire operation.

The pattern surfaced repeatedly across member organisations. Individual teams ran successful sustainability pilots in IT, but those pilots couldn't cross departmental boundaries. Procurement continued buying without carbon considerations. Operations deployed without energy awareness. Executive decision-making lacked the data pipelines to factor in software emissions. As the SOFT ratification article put it: "organizations had the tools, yet they struggled to use them systematically across their operations."

For banks like HSBC and UBS, this wasn't abstract. HSBC had committed to net zero in operations and supply chain by 2030. Natalie Pullin's team wanted to "give our Technology staff the tools to feel empowered to contribute to the transition to net zero in a practical way through their daily work." But as Tim Smolcic noted, "there has been a lack of industry-wide best practices and education on how technology can help engineers contribute to net zero." The gap wasn't knowledge -- it was organisational architecture.

### The Journey

The story begins not in a boardroom but on a sailing boat. Pindy Bhullar joined an Exxpedition voyage to collect ocean samples for plastic analysis. On the final night, the group debated how to translate their experiences into action. Pindy recalled her childhood -- "my family growing our own vegetables, and my parents reusing and recycling items because waste prevention was an act of consciousness" -- and drew a simple triangle connecting projects, technology, and sustainability. She began a PhD research journey into how organisations could embed green software at every level.

At UBS, Pindy established the Sustainable Technology Guild, an internal group formed once UBS became a GSF member that helped the firm cut emissions by sharing best practices and developing practical tools. She applied the SCI Specification at UBS, walking through the three key stages: understanding software boundaries, defining functional units, and breaking down operational and embodied emissions. But she saw that measurement alone wasn't enough. Organisations needed a framework for transformation.

In 2023, Pindy raised what was initially called TOSS (Transforming Organisations for Sustainable Software) within the Standards Working Group. Co-chaired with Sean O'Keefe from Microsoft, the project grew into a collaboration across eight companies. The framework was designed to address carbon emissions holistically -- recognising that "carbon emissions from software don't fall solely under technology departments."

The resulting Sustainable Organisational Framework for Technology (SOFT) covers four essential areas: Strategy (governance structures and net-zero alignment), Implementation (data collection and tool deployment), Operational (embedding practices into daily work -- code review checklists, carbon-aware deployment, procurement guidelines), and Compliance & Regulations (alignment with CSRD, CSDDD, EU AI Act and emerging requirements).

Built to complement the GSF's Maturity Matrix Model, SOFT provides decision trees, capability assessments, templates, checklists, and maturity matrices -- addressing different personas from CTOs to developers to sustainability leads.

SOFT was ratified in November 2025. By October 2025, four global GSF member organisations were already piloting the framework, working directly with the project lead to test it across their operations and specific departments. These early adopters were "already seeing the framework's potential to navigate key challenges, such as data gaps, tool integration decisions, and securing buy-in, regardless of organizational size, industry, or maturity."

The team is now developing a two-level SOFT course and gathering pilot feedback to inform SOFT v2.0, planned for early 2026.

### The Impact

- **Ratified standard** -- SOFT ratified November 2025, providing the first organisational transformation framework for green software
- **4 pilot organisations** implementing the framework across their operations as of October 2025
- **8 companies contributed** to the framework's development (HSBC, Microsoft, Avanade, BCG X, Cisco, NTT DATA, Siemens, UBS)
- **4 operational domains** covered: Strategy, Implementation, Operational, Compliance & Regulations
- **Training material in development** -- two-level SOFT course being created
- **SOFT v2.0 planned** for early 2026, informed by pilot feedback
- **Doctoral research foundation** -- the framework evolved alongside Pindy Bhullar's PhD research, grounding it in academic rigour

### Call to Action

Explore the SOFT Framework on GitHub and assess where your organisation sits on the maturity matrix. If your teams have the tools but lack the organisational architecture to scale green software practices, SOFT provides the decision trees, templates, and action steps to move from pilot to company-wide transformation. Join the GSF to pilot SOFT in your organisation and contribute to v2.0.

### Open Questions

- **Names of the 4 pilot organisations** are not disclosed in any published article -- we know they are "global GSF member organizations" but specific names and outcomes are unknown
- **Specific metrics from pilots** -- no quantitative results from the pilot implementations have been published yet (expected in SOFT v2.0 feedback)
- **Sean O'Keefe's exact title at Microsoft** is not specified in the source articles
- **Pindy Bhullar's exact institutional affiliation for her PhD** is not stated -- the directory lists her current affiliation as ClimateAction.tech, while articles reference HSBC and UBS
- **Timeline of the TOSS-to-SOFT renaming** is unclear -- the project appears as TOSS in mid-2024 articles and as SOFT by the ratification in November 2025
- **Whether the two-level SOFT course has launched** -- the ratification article mentions it is being worked on but does not give a release date
