          About the Green Software Foundation
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-primary-darkest">
          The SCI specification is developed and maintained by the Green Software Foundation (GSF), a nonprofit consortium under the Linux Foundation dedicated to building a future where software has zero harmful environmental impact. With steering members including Accenture, Avanade, BCG X, Cisco, Google, Microsoft, NTT Data, Siemens, and UBS, GSF creates trusted standards, tools, and education for sustainable software development.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 text-primary-darkest">
          Beyond the SCI specification, the foundation develops open-source tools like the Impact Framework and Carbon Aware SDK, and has trained over 130,000 practitioners in green software principles worldwide.
