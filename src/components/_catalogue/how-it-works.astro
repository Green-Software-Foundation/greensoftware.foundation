        A New Way to Think About Software

        The SCI score combines three essential factors that determine software's carbon footprint: the energy your software consumes (E), the carbon intensity of that energy based on location and time (I), and the embodied emissions from manufacturing the hardware (M). These are calculated per functional unit (R) - creating a rate that reveals true efficiency.

          SCI = (E × I + M) per R

        This simple equation transforms how teams approach software development. Instead of guessing at environmental impact, you can measure it. Instead of generic best practices, you have specific targets. Instead of greenwashing, you have genuine reductions.
