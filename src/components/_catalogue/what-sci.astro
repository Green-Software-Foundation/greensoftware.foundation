        </h1>
        <p class="mt-6 text-lg md:text-xl">
          The Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification is an ISO-accredited standard (ISO/IEC 21031:2024) for measuring the carbon emissions of software applications. It provides a clear, consistent methodology that transforms complex environmental data into a single actionable score—making it possible to compare different software solutions, track improvements over time, and make evidence-based decisions about technology choices.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl">
          Unlike traditional carbon accounting that focuses on totals and offsets, SCI calculates a rate—carbon emissions per functional unit of your software, whether that's per user, per transaction, or per API call. This approach reveals the true efficiency of your software and guides you toward meaningful reductions through better code, smarter infrastructure choices, and carbon-aware computing strategies.
