## **Can you tell us about ClimateAction.tech?**

[ClimateAction.tech](https://climateaction.tech/) (CAT) is a global community of tech workers who are passionate about reducing the climate impact of digital products and internet technology. With over 10,000 members, we come together to learn, collaborate, and share ways to be more sustainable in our roles as tech professionals. We believe that everyone has a part to play in addressing the climate crisis. In 2023, we formalized our mission by incorporating as a Community Interest Company (CIC). We invite you to join us!

## **How does sustainability manifest in your organization?  **

Sustainability is at the center of all of our community discussions and programs. When CAT first began in 2017, we were focused on the carbon footprint of websites and software. As our community grew, we became more diverse and international, and our understanding of the climate crisis evolved into a more holistic, systems-view of sustainability that includes social issues as well. These days, our members discuss topics ranging from implementing low-carbon software to climate policy to culture and systems change. 

Our community has worked diligently to create an open space where people can explore, test ideas, and receive feedback without fear of repercussion. We need spaces to imagine and ideate in order to transform the tech industry and society at large. 

We envision a tech industry that prioritizes people and life—an industry that supports dignified work, fair and equal pay, health, and well-being. A tech industry that uses its power and influence to advocate for and accelerate fair climate solutions.

## **Why did you join the GSF?**

A large part of our membership consists of experienced independent technologists, and we see the Green Software Foundation as a place where green software standards, tools, and best practices are defined. 

Joining the GSF made sense so that we could extend our internal discussions to the larger enterprise community and other climate organizations. We believe that the cross-pollination of ideas will benefit everyone, and joining the GSF provides the resources and standards needed to scale our collective impact.

## **Are there any other sustainability initiatives that you can share?**

Our CAT Mini Grants program funds community projects that advance climate advocacy and sustainable software development. Members can apply for funding to build tools, create resources, or run initiatives that benefit the broader community.

We also coordinate several programs through Slack, including a systems-thinking series, a green software book club, and other events. We’re currently planning [a series on responsible AI development starting in October](https://luma.com/2cf0sfmc), and members can use our #local channels to meet at in-person events. 

In collaboration with the Green Web Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, and EIT Climate KIC, we publish [*Branch Magazine*](https://branch.climateaction.tech/), an online magazine for people who want a sustainable and just internet for all.

If any of this interests you, please [join our Slack](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtvNeUkNkPybk9_Ln5klL1RUPHUCwfK4OfF-odRWnHME9d-g/viewform), sign up for [our newsletter](https://buttondown.com/climateActionTech), or subscribe to our [Lu.ma](http://lu.ma) calendar. 

## **How do you hope to contribute to and benefit from the GSF?**

We have members who are involved in developing standards, policies, and tools. We hope to connect them to the GSF’s working groups to advance more sustainable practices in software. We also want to help amplify the adoption of GSF standards across diverse organizations, from independent developers to enterprise teams.

We look forward to collaborating with the GSF and its members!
