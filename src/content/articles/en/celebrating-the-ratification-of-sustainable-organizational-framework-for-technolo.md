In 2021, we began building methods, tools, standards, and patterns to help practitioners embed green software practices. As these tools, including [the Software Carbon Intensity specification](https://sci.greensoftware.foundation/), [Impact Framework](https://if.greensoftware.foundation/), and [Carbon Aware SDK](https://carbon-aware-sdk.greensoftware.foundation/), matured within a wider landscape of sustainability frameworks and methodologies, a pattern surfaced: organizations had the tools, yet they struggled to use them systematically across their operations.

A common need emerged: organizations needed more than measurement tools—they needed a framework to embed green software practices systematically across their operations, from board-level strategy to developer workflows.

We are thrilled to announce the ratification of the Sustainable Organizational Framework for Technology (SOFT), previously known as TOSS (Transforming Organizational Software Sustainability), under the leadership of Pindy Bhullar (Technology Sustainability Consultant at HSBC) and co-chair Sean O'Keefe (Microsoft).

Reaching this milestone represents a major step in enabling organizations to turn green software tools into company-wide practices, accelerating the sector's contribution to global net-zero targets.

## What SOFT Ratification Means for Green Software

SOFT helps changemakers understand how to embed green software calculations and tools, guiding organizations to effectively use emissions data to reduce carbon. 

The framework recognizes that carbon emissions from software don't fall solely under technology departments. To respond to that, SOFT integrates methodologies and tools across entire organizations, from procurement to operations to executive decision-making.

It provides decision trees, capability assessments, and clear action steps, supported by templates, checklists, and maturity matrices. Addressing the needs of different personas, from CTOs to developers to sustainability leads, SOFT offers an actionable path forward. 

> *"SOFT gives changemakers the structured approach they need to reduce carbon emissions from software operations while achieving their business objectives—embedding sustainable software practices into the DNA of the business."*

## A Closer Look at SOFT

SOFT's framework covers four essential areas:

- **Strategy**: Establishing governance structures and sustainability objectives to enable measuring success and alignment with net-zero commitments. 
- **Implementation**: Setting up data collection systems and deploying tools like the Impact Framework and SCI specification, connecting your monitoring systems to carbon measurement.
- **Operational**: Embedding practices into daily operations: code review checklists that include carbon considerations, deployment strategies that favor cleaner energy periods, and procurement guidelines that factor in embodied carbon.
- **Compliance & Regulations**: Ensuring alignment with evolving sustainability regulations, helping you stay ahead as governments worldwide introduce digital sustainability requirements.

Built to complement the [GSF's Maturity Matrix Model](https://maturity-matrix.greensoftware.foundation/), SOFT enables businesses to assess their current sustainability maturity, identify gaps, and identify clear next steps. 

### Charting Progress

As of October 2025, four global GSF member organizations are working with the project lead to pilot and test the framework across their operations and specific departments. 

These early adopters are already seeing the framework's potential to navigate key challenges, such as data gaps, tool integration decisions, and securing buy-in, regardless of organizational size, industry, or maturity. 

Pilot feedback will inform the development of SOFT v2.0, which we plan to release in early 2026. While the framework will remain generic rather than industry-specific, pilot learnings will create supplementary guidance for different organizational contexts.

We’re also working on publishing a two-level SOFT course to help organizations better understand and implement the framework. 

## Building on Our Values

SOFT reflects our commitment to an actionable, evidence-based approach to reducing the environmental impact of software. By supporting organizations with both strategic planning tools and developer-focused resources, SOFT aligns directly with GSF's mission of democratizing access to green software practices.

Developed as a living framework, SOFT evolves alongside industry innovations, new sustainability standards, and ongoing research, including the doctoral study that shaped its foundations.

As the industry looks ahead, the project plays a central role in translating GSF's tools and standards into organization-wide transformation.

## Get Involved

We warmly invite organizations from around the world to explore the SOFT Framework, adopt it, and share their feedback. Your input will help us refine and grow its positive impact together.
