# **What the Policy Radar Ratification Means for Green Software**

In 2024, it became clear that many tech and sustainability professionals are facing growing challenges in keeping up with new environmental legislation. With limited visibility into forthcoming regulations, there is a real risk of missing opportunities to participate, adapt, and align with emerging policies on software sustainability and emissions reporting.

While GSF members and industry experts already offer guidance on existing regulations and law implementation, there is less visibility into developing legislation and policies. This is where the Policy Radar aims to fill the gap. Proposed by Chris Adams, Director of Technology and Policy at the Green Web Foundation, in March 2024, the initiative builds a shared, transparent view of the evolving policy landscape.

We’re proud to announce the ratification of the Policy Radar under the leadership of Chris Adams. This marks a key milestone in our ongoing work to align policy, practice, and sustainability in the digital space.

In this article, we share more about the project, its role, and how to get involved.

# **A Closer Look at the Policy Radar **

> "As we face a surge of new environmental legislation, navigating the complexities of greening software and emissions reporting is increasingly daunting. Knowing which laws are coming and when to engage in the policy making process is half of the battle, and this project helps members address environmental impacts proactively, with integrity, and to ensure compliance with evolving standards."

The primary goal of the Policy Radar is to track and surface forthcoming legislation that is likely to impact green software, digital infrastructure, and the broader tech ecosystem. As a collaborative public calendar of upcoming policy events and opportunities, the initiative serves as a tool for members to submit proposals and policy responses.

By offering early insight into what's coming, it allows members to collaborate and act before laws are finalized, effectively participating in policy development.

The project offers key benefits across these dimensions: 

- **Knowledge Building**: By giving members early visibility into upcoming laws and deadlines, it enables more informed engagement, supports public discourse, and drives more effective policy outcomes aligned with our mission.
- **Shape Tech Culture**: It encourages cultural shift by incentivizing greener procurement, supporting more sustainable workplace policies, and driving the transparency needed to build genuinely greener software.
- **Support Tooling**: By connecting lawmakers and practitioners, it enhances the effectiveness of future legislation and increases the likelihood that practical standards will be widely adopted. 

The current [<u>database</u>](https://policy-radar.greensoftware.foundation/) includes an overview of upcoming policy events, such as open consultations and new active and passed laws. It covers the main affected territories and relevant areas in green software, highlights relevant deadlines, ways to get involved, and how it may affect relevant groups.  

We’re already finding it useful to understand what kinds of consultations from policy makers to respond to, and over the coming months, we intend to increase the geographic coverage, particularly outside of North America and Europe. The radar is designed to have a low barrier to entry for submitting policy—anyone can suggest an event for the radar, although there is a moderation process to make sure the events on the radar are useful to GSF members. 

# **Building on Our Values**

The Policy Radar reflects many of [<u>the values we hold</u>](https://greensoftware.foundation/manifesto). By offering a shared, transparent view of the changing policy landscape, this initiative empowers members to respond to regulatory shifts with clarity, confidence, and collaborative readiness. 

In a time when environmental legislation is accelerating globally, the radar helps tech leaders and practitioners understand what lies ahead. Thus, they can contribute meaningfully to the policy-making process and align their practices with emerging compliance requirements and our collective responsibility to reduce emissions. 

As more contributors and users actively engage with the initiative, we’re better equipped to respond to change, influence policy outcomes, and build trust through transparent, inclusive collaboration. 

# **Get Involved**

We invite GSF members to use and contribute to the project. To submit new policies that may directly affect you and your organization, visit [<u>the Policy Radar page</u>](https://policy-radar.greensoftware.foundation/). 

To better understand the sustainability policy landscape and the future of global legislation, we encourage stakeholders to align themselves with leading organizations in green software.  

GSF members are working together to make an impact, led by our Steering Members: Avanade, BCG X, Cisco, Google, Microsoft, NTT DATA Corporation, Siemens, and UBS.
