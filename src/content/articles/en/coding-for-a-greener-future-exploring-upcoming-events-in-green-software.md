The software development and design community, particularly, is at a pivotal moment in history. It's a moment where the power of coding can be harnessed with a focus on actively contributing to the planet's sustainability, shaping a digital landscape that champions environmental responsibility above all else.

We are putting a spotlight on upcoming events that are set to change the way we code, design, monitor, and measure the environmental impact of our digital creations. You can use them as stepping stones to incorporate sustainability in your daily work and embrace the myriad of opportunities available to enhance your craft and leave a positive mark on the world.

Many of the events listed below feature sessions influenced by the principles, patterns, and tools contributed by the GSF community. These sessions are led by individuals actively involved in GSF or helping to promote our initiatives.

In addition to upcoming events organized by peers, members, and supporters, the GSF is hosting a virtual [Panel on Responsible AI](https://www.meetup.com/gsf-global/events/295596991/) on October 5 and its flagship event, [Decarbonize Software](https://decarb.greensoftware.foundation/), on November 16. We hope you join us!
