We, at the Green Software Foundation, released our Q1 2022 report on Monday 11th April. 

### You can view our report offline as a [PDF](https://grnsft.org/reports/2022/q1/pdf) or online as a [Google Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18D0MHzRDcu8ZT6B8eO6f5OkPfIlUIRsGQ6MIs3bfgks/edit?usp=sharinghttps://grnsft.org/reports/2022/q1/slides).
## We are growing

The report records our impressive growth, having more than tripled our membership, from the eight original members. Today, our membership consists of a balanced mix of for profits, nonprofits and academic institutions who have joined us on our mission to create a trusted ecosystem of people, standards, tooling, and best practices for building green software. 

> Our growth proves that we are filling a long-ignored need in the software space. Whatever their role in a software team, those who want to do their job as sustainably as possible know they can come to the Green Software Foundation; that we would have the answers.
> ~ Asim Hussain, Chair of the Green Software Foundation 

## We are spreading the message of green software worldwide 

To reflect the diversity and enthusiasm of the GSF community, we began by translating our content into [five languages](https://greensoftware.foundation/manifesto). Our translations into Mandarin, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish and German together with English puts our content potentially within the reach of 46% of the global population. More languages will join this list soon. 

## We are going places

### The GSF Global Summit 2022

The first ever GSF Global Summit will be held in over 30 venues across four continents in June 2022. The summit events, hosted/co hosted by GSF members—Accenture, Avanade, BCG GAMMA, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, NTT DATA, Shell and Thoughtworks—comprise a mix of in person, virtual and hybrid events to educate technology professionals, from software engineers to technology executives, on the importance and principles of green software.
