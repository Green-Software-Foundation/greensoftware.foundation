May 31, 2023/– The Green Software Foundation (GSF) has announced the release of the [2023 State of Green Software](http://stateof.greensoftware.foundation) (SOGS) report - the first-ever analysis of green software, globally and across industries. This digital publication shares 30 insights into trends, challenges, and opportunities to increase investment in green software and the wide-scale adoption of tools and principles to reduce software’s harmful effects on the environment. 

According to researchers, software is expected to account for [14%](https://hbr.org/2020/09/how-green-is-your-software) of the world’s carbon footprint by 2040. The report presents a clearer picture of what's working for the sustainability agenda, and consolidates data practitioners at any level can use to get buy-in from leadership to build greener solutions. 

"I have wished for a resource like The State of Green Software report for four years, and I am thrilled it's finally here. Nobody has to spend hours anymore hunting for information that will convince leadership to invest in green software projects," says Asim Hussain, Executive Director and Chairperson of the Green Software Foundation.

The insights come from the results of the SOGS survey, conducted in 2022 by the GSF, and data and findings from secondary research and interviews with software industry practitioners. The data is shared through “insight bytes,” responding to pressing questions about the rate of green software adoption across industries, recent academic research on the impact of software, leading tools for decarbonizing software, and use cases on greening software. The report also signals how policy and regulatory frameworks may change as software's dominance grows. 

The GSF encourages software practitioners to use the SOGS report as a resource to get their sustainability and green software projects off the ground to decarbonize their software. 

To help celebrate this momentous occasion, the GSF is hosting a [**live event on June 5th**](https://www.meetup.com/gsf-global/events/293634147) for World Environment Day to introduce green software and key insights shared in the report.
