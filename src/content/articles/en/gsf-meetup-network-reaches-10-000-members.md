At a turning point for the tech industry, where software takes a central role in shaping a sustainable future, community-driven initiatives are essential to growing the green software movement. 

With over 10,000 members across 36 groups in 19 countries, the Meetup community unites dedicated professionals committed to advancing sustainable tech. Through expert-led events and knowledge-sharing, these Meetup groups help educate more practitioners about software’s environmental impact and empower them to take meaningful action. But they offer more than that—they provide a supportive environment where real connections and a shared vision drive change.

GSF Meetup organizers share what motivates them, key insights from the community building, and how anyone can get involved.

## A Closer Look at the GSF Meetup Community 

Meetup organizers come from diverse backgrounds, each with a unique journey into green software. For some, it was a deliberate pursuit of sustainability; for others, a surprising discovery that changed their perspective. Regardless of their entry point, they all share a common goal to make software greener and more responsible. 

“When we started the Meetup group, other organizers and I were part of a tech sustainability group at my former company,” says April Bates, lead organizer of Code Green London. “We were looking for a meaningful way to make a difference, and when the idea of starting a London Meetup came up, we decided to roll with it. It's been nearly two years since the first Meetup, and we still love organizing it.” 

For some, discovering green software transformed their approach. Texas organizer Clifton Reddy’s journey began unexpectedly when he stumbled upon an article discussing the energy consumption of programming languages.

“Learning about GSF’s work sparked my curiosity about software’s impact on carbon emissions, highlighting often-overlooked aspects of our daily work as programmers and architects. Inspired, I wanted to contribute, and the opportunity came when Asim (Hussain) invited me to become an organizer in response to one of my comments,” he recalls.

GSF Meetups offer a wide range of discussions, from building sustainability cultures within organizations to practical strategies for reducing software emissions. These events feature industry experts and academic voices, offering a broad spectrum of perspectives on sustainable tech.

At a recent Code Green London event, which attracted over 70 participants, Mark Butcher, Director at Posetiv Cloud Ltd, shared insights on cloud carbon emissions, while Oliver Cronk, Technology Director, Scott Logic, provided an update on their use of the Open Source Technology Carbon Standard. Meanwhile, a popular Karlsruhe Meetup explored the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and its potential impact on Green Software Development.

## Building on Our Values

Community is the backbone of the green software movement, helping us stay resilient and united during challenging times. Meetup groups contribute to GSF's mission of building a trusted ecosystem of people, standards, tooling, and best practices for green software by helping software practitioners, from newcomers to tech leaders, drive sustainable change. 

Aydin Mir Mohammadi, founder and organizer of Green Software Development Karlsruhe, a Meetup group with over 670 members and 30+ hosted events, strongly believes in the power of community. “I discovered many years ago that I have an impact on the environment within my profession and wanted to learn more about it,” says Aydin. “And I definitely wanted to reduce the emissions of my software. So I did what I always do—start a community and exchange ideas with like-minded people.”

Rut Palmero, who recently hosted the first Meetup for the Spanish audience, sees these gatherings as a key step toward embedding sustainability into the ICT sector.  “We must make sustainability an integral element throughout the software life cycle, methodologically, in the same way we did in the past with quality or security. But the paradigm shift is complex,” she explains. “This is why the GSF Meetup groups are essential—they help identify professionals who can lead this change in their organizations and bring a local perspective to global challenges.”

## Get Involved 

The GSF Meetup network thrives because of its passionate organizers and engaged members. The group organizers are always open to collaborating with new people, highlights April. Code Green London has worked with ClimateAction.Tech and made valuable connections through the LinkedIn network. 

“My advice is to keep reaching out to people who might be interested in the project. So many people have been incredibly helpful,” she adds.
