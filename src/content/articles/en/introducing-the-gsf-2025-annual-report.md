As we look back on the past year, we are proud to share our 2025 Annual Report. It reflects on GSF’s work across the ecosystem, highlights key milestones and achievements, and previews our priorities for 2026. It also helps our members, partners, and broader community stay informed about how we are advancing sustainability.

In 2025, we made progress on what matters most: building practical, consensus-based standards and tools that organizations can use to measure and reduce software’s environmental impact. 

## A Closer Look at the 2025 Annual Report

Last year was marked by several milestones, including: 

- 5 Key Projects Ratified: Impact Framework, Real Time Energy and Carbon Standard for Cloud Providers (RTC), Sustainable Organizational Framework for Technology (SOFT), Policy Radar, and Software Carbon Intensity for AI (SCI for AI). 
- Launch of the Hardware Standards Working Group. 
- New partnerships with the Government Digital Sustainability Alliance (GDSA), the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), and the International Association of Software Architects (IASA). 
- Movement Platform launch to increase adoption through training and connection-building.  
- Green AI Position Paper release.
