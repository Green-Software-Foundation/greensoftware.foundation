Last Tuesday, we held our first Meetup of the year in London. We were thrilled to see 27 enthusiastic practitioners attend in person for insightful talks on Green Software Principles and Patterns and a panel discussion with industry leaders. 

Key highlights included having Liya Mathew from Goldman Sachs as a first-time speaker sharing her ah-ha moment with Green Software and Asim Hussain, Chris Adams, Daniel Vaughn, and Sarah Hsu sharing their sustainability journey and contributions to the Green Software Foundation. The event also inspired one participant to start a GSF community in Brighton, UK. 

In addition, a message that every speaker echoed emphasized the vital role of community in (re)shaping a green tech culture, which places the environment and people at the heart of every design and development decision.

Community-driven initiatives are how we get things done at the foundation. Cooperative partnerships and cross-industry collaboration brought new resources and tools like the [Carbon Aware API/SDK](https://greensoftware.foundation/projects), [Green Patterns Catalog](https://patterns.greensoftware.foundation/) and the [Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) Specification](https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/green-software-foundation-expands-efforts-to-incentivize-decarbonization-in-t) to market.

If you're passionate about ensuring software has zero harmful effects on the environment and want to be a more active advocate and ambassador for climate-conscious software, here's what we suggest you do next:

1. Subscribe to the [Green Software Foundation newsletter](https://greensoftware.foundation/) to stay up-to-date with our latest initiatives and events.
2. Reach out to the [Green Software Foundation's Meetup Group](https://meetup.greensoftware.foundation/) to unlock a broader community of practitioners who can help you decide on a topic and share best practices in setting up a local Meetup (e.g., time, venue, days, activities).
3. Explore the [Speakers Bureau](https://speakers.greensoftware.foundation/) to connect with potential speakers who can share their experiences and insights on carbon aware computing and green tech.
4. Find like-minded friends and peers, and don't be afraid to "voluntell" people in your network to get involved!

During tough times, community helps keep us resilient and connected–to each other and the work we love doing. Every software practitioner at any level can play a role in building a green tech culture and decarbonizing software. Whether you're a senior software developer, a junior project manager, or an executive technology leader, prioritizing carbon awareness in your work and advocating to look at problems and opportunities with a greener lens will increase momentum in reducing software's harmful impacts on the environment.
