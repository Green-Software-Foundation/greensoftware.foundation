## Tell us about Container Solutions and what your company expects to achieve from the association with the Green Software Foundation.
[Container Solutions](https://www.container-solutions.com/) is a European consultancy firm. We want to help shape the direction of tech architecture so our industry is directly responsible for a lot less carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere. That's not because we are a bunch of do-gooders. It is because  it's the future.

## Tell us about your career path, your interest in green software and your journey to GSF. 
I've been in the tech industry since the early nineties as an engineer on high performance server products like Microsoft Exchange. I then moved to the enterprise side and was head of IT for one of the earliest pure-play online retailers in international lingerie! I founded several startups, and the last one was about improving the efficiency of software hosting, which is how I met Container Solutions and got involved in the community side of sustainable development. 

## What do you expect to achieve by working with the GSF and in green software in general?
Container Solutions and I want the same thing. We want to work with the tech community to understand what sustainable, green practices look like and then share them and get the whole industry on board.

## What obstacles do you see to green software? How do you think we can overcome them? 
It's the "Don't Look Up!" issue. How do we get attention? Green, sustainable practices are coming, but sooner would be a lot better than later. We just need to get the message out there and communicate it clearly, over and over again. AWS's Sustainability pillar announcement at the last Re:Invent was a big help because it made it clear that sustainability is a key part of engineering from now on. We need to build on that.
