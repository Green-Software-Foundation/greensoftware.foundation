[<u>BCG GAMMA</u>](https://www.bcg.com/beyond-consulting/bcg-gamma/default) is BCG’s global team dedicated to applying artificial intelligence and advanced analytics to critical business problems at leading companies and organizations. The team includes more than 1,500 data scientists and engineers who utilize AI and advanced analytics (including machine learning, deep learning, optimization, simulation, natural language, and image analytics) to build solutions that transform business performance. BCG GAMMA’s approach builds value and competitive advantage at the intersection of data science, technology, people, business processes, and ways of working. 

## **What does BCG GAMMA plan to achieve together with the Green Software Foundation, for your business and for the world?**

We believe that BCG, like all businesses, needs to take a multi-stakeholder lens and make a positive difference in society. BCG has a strong commitment to contribute to a better planet – through our client work, our partnerships, and our own operations. We have committed to reducing our own footprint, and to reach Net Zero by 2030. 

Joining Green Software Foundation is part of our commitment to actively engage as part of the solution to climate change. Together, we look forward to learning from each other’s experiences and building standards, best practices, and tools that can be used by our clients and the world to eliminate software emissions. 

## **How does BCG GAMMA see the future of green software? **

If recent history is any indicator, the use of computing in general and AI computing, in particular, will continue to expand exponentially around the world – along with the amount of energy consumed and greenhouse gas emissions released. 

We envision a future where sustainability is a cornerstone of software development. Through the work of the Green Software Foundation, standards and best practices will become not only commonplace, but also easily accessible, driving adoption and innovation across the industry.  

## **What challenges can get in the way of progress of green software and how do we overcome them?**

We see two key challenges on the road to adoption: awareness and action. It requires a change in culture and ways of working to build software that abates emissions, not just neutralizes them.  

To tackle the first challenge, we need a set of standards and tools that allow people to measure and understand the carbon footprint of their software. It’s critical to share a common vocabulary and a set of possible levers across industries to enable effective reduction.

We believe the next decade will be one of transformation. Software engineering is and will be the central piece of the puzzle. People across the globe realize the fact it is no more a matter of discussion but of action, so as soon as we properly measure our impact, it will be a collective effort as a society to act.
