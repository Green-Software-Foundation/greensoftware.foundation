Our members consistently tell us the same thing: they struggle to anticipate which upcoming regulations will impact their competitiveness and how to prepare. With environmental legislation accelerating globally, the gap between those who write the policies and those who implement the technology continues to grow. 

To address this challenge, we're defining the Policy Working Group's approach. Here you will learn more about our refined mission, how we plan to implement it, and our priorities for this year. 

## What Does Our Mission Mean for Green Software?

> *"Rather than traditional lobbying, we focus on translating our deep technical expertise into accessible insights that inform better policy decisions around software sustainability."*

The Green Software Foundation's Policy Working Group (PWG), led by Chris Adams (Green Web Foundation) and Aya Saed (Scope3), represents a strategic evolution in how we approach sustainable software advocacy. 

The PWG aims to engage with external bodies and campaigns, commenting on existing or proposed policy related to green software as well as creating our own policy proposals and managing projects related to the green certification of products and services.

In conversations with policymakers, we've found they are genuinely hungry for more information and guidance in navigating this complex technical terrain into actionable policy. 

We respond to this need by:

- Converting complex research into clear frameworks: We transform technical concepts into language policymakers can act on 
- Facilitating evidence-based dialogue: We connect software practitioners with policymakers to ensure regulations reflect technical reality 
- Providing technical expertise: We submit consultation responses grounded in measurement data and implementation experience 
- Tracking emerging policies: Through our [newly ratified Policy Radar](https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/celebrating-the-ratification-of-the-policy-radar), we give members early visibility into regulations that will impact their work 

### What We Don’t Do 

We don’t endorse specific legislation or candidates, engage in lobbying as a primary activity, or advocate for partisan political positions. 

## Building on Our Values

Our approach centers on being a trusted, nonpartisan resource for policymakers who need to understand the technical realities of software's environmental impact.

The PWG operates on five core principles: legitimacy, opportunity, consistency, transparency, and accountability, aligned with the UN Global Compact Guide for Responsible Corporate Engagement in Climate Policy and GSF values. 

The PWG embodies these principles by offering a facilitating dialogue, providing expertise, and tracking policy developments, ultimately enabling both members and policymakers to navigate change with confidence and shared understanding.

## Get Involved

We are working to ensure that green software policies are rooted in technical reality and drive meaningful emissions reductions. Our current priorities include: 

- Coordinating responses to the New York Senate's Corporate Climate Accountability Act
- Engaging with international initiatives like the European Green Digital Coalition
- Strengthening strategic partnerships while actively tracking state-level AI regulations across the US
