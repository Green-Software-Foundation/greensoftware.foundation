Software and hardware have traditionally been developed in isolation from one another, each with their set of standards and protocols, without necessarily considering the other. Now, as we dive deeper into an AI-driven world, the opportunity to better understand the challenges of digital infrastructure and actively participate in the development of hardware standards comes at a defining time for software.

For the first time in hardware’s history, software is becoming the central thread that ties everything together to drive sustainability forward. Through the standards working groups and projects led by the Developer Relations Committee, practitioners will have the necessary ecosystems and mechanisms to create standards that integrate seamlessly with hardware, share workload insights to bridge knowledge gaps, and contribute to hardware standards that ensure interoperability across different platforms.

*“In the past, making tech more sustainable has focused heavily on hardware efficiency, often relegating software to a secondary role,” said Sanjay Podder, Former Chair of the GSF Board. “Uniting hardware and software standards creates an opportunity for software to lead the ICT sector in reducing emissions.”*

A Closer Look at SSIA Joining the GSF

In addition to the Software Standards Working Group, the Foundation will launch a Hardware Standards Working Group to continue building hardware standards for improved efficiency, alongside other initiatives. This will kick off with:

1. **Hardware specifications**: Establishing protocols that signal enabling energy, telecoms, cooling systems, and software applications to work in harmony for carbon-efficient operations.
2. **Next-Gen Cooling Standards**: Developing guidelines for advanced cooling technologies, including liquid and immersion cooling, to improve energy efficiency in data centers.
3. **Green Infrastructure Practitioners Course**: Inspired by the Green Software Practitioners Course, this program will teach professionals how to implement sustainable practices in digital infrastructure.

This brings new member organizations specializing in infrastructure and data centers, who are already focused on developing new Specifications and Standards around this area. Join us in welcoming the SSIA to the GSF. 

## Building on Our Values

At the heart of every decision we make is our commitment to openness, collaboration, and fairness. All standards for both software and hardware will be opensource, ensuring they’re accessible to everyone and designed to drive collective progress. We’ll continue to use the consensus-based model that’s been our foundation from the start, giving every member an equal voice in shaping the purpose, scope, and details of our standards.

We’re looking forward to continuing to provide spaces where individuals can share ideas and innovations and build a repository of toolkits and resources to ensure that what we develop strengthens the interplay between software and hardware. 

## Get Involved

**Become a Member:** If you’re not already a member, [join the Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/join-us) to help develop the next generation of software and hardware standards.

**Participate in the Hardware Standards Workshop:** member organizations can [express interest](https://workshops.greensoftware.foundation/mycelium-workshop) in joining the initial Hardware Standards Workshop in Q1 2025. This invite-only session will bring together leading voices in software and hardware sustainability to collaborate on the Hardware Standards Working Group charter and initial projects.
