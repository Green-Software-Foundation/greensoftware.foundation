The Green Software Foundation (GSF) and SustainableArchitectures.org are proud to announce a strategic partnership to advance knowledge-sharing and collaboration between their global communities, empowering architects and developers to make sustainability a fundamental consideration in software design and infrastructure decisions, alongside performance, security, and cost.

## About SustainableArchitectures.org

Founded in 2024 under IASA Global by President Paul Preiss, SustainableArchitectures.org was created to embed sustainability and responsible AI as core pillars of enterprise architecture. Operating as a nonprofit initiative within IASA Global, SustainableArchitectures.org can leverage a leading knowledge-based association for Business Technology architecture dedicated to advancing best practices and education to develop highly skilled architects. By integrating SustainableArchitectures.org's programs—covering sustainability certification, research, Sustainability and Responsible AI assessments, and architectural artifacts into the IASA Business Technology Architecture Body of Knowledge (BTABoK) framework, we position architecture as a core pillar of modern business technology strategy with a focus on sustainability.

## About the Green Software Foundation (GSF)

The Green Software Foundation is a 501(c)(6) nonprofit under the Linux Foundation, building a trusted ecosystem of people, standards, tooling, and best practices to reduce the environmental impacts of software. With Steering Committee members including Avanade, BCG X, Cisco, Google, Microsoft, NTT DATA, Siemens, and UBS, GSF develops open standards and measurement tools that help developers and organizations measure and reduce software carbon emissions.

## A Unified Vision for Sustainable Technology

Through this partnership, SustainableArchitectures.org and the GSF will advance sustainable architecture and green software practices by connecting architects and developers with measurement tools, educational resources, and communities of practice. Together, the organizations will:

**Align Architecture and Software Design with Environmental Impact**: Advance techniques and tooling that quantify and reduce the carbon footprint of software, leveraging architectural decisions and engineering patterns.

**Foster Community Engagement**: Bring together global architects, engineers, and sustainability advocates to exchange knowledge and co-develop open-source artifacts.

**Develop ESG-Aligned Reference Architectures**: Build frameworks that guide organizations in embedding sustainability across digital, cloud, and software delivery strategies. Architecture working groups include:

- Business Architecture
- Architectural Strategy and Governance
- Solution Architecture
- Data and Responsible AI Architecture
- Security, Risk, and Compliance Architecture
- Infrastructure Architecture
- Metrics and GreenOps

**Educate and Certify Leaders**: Jointly contribute to sustainability architecture and green software certifications, training programs, and architecture curricula to build industry capabilities.

**Champion Responsible AI**: Collaborate on governance models that ensure AI and ML models are energy-efficient, ethically designed, and sustainability compliant.

**Showcase Real-World Impact**: Share case studies, metrics, and success stories that demonstrate how green software and architecture practices reduce emissions and drive innovation.

Through these collaborative efforts, both organizations aim to make sustainability a fundamental consideration in technology decision-making: measured, actionable, and integrated into every phase of the software and systems lifecycle. This approach helps companies achieve net-zero goals while maintaining business resilience and innovation.

## Driving the Future of Low-Carbon Technology

> As the climate crisis accelerates, architecture and software leaders must rise to the challenge by embedding sustainability into their core design principles. Our partnership with GSF will help operationalize this vision by equipping enterprises with actionable frameworks and measurable guidance. This collaboration connects the dots between enterprise architecture and engineering. Together, we can establish a shared responsibility model for reducing digital carbon footprints—without compromising innovation.
> Architects make decisions that ripple through entire technology ecosystems—from infrastructure design to application deployment. By connecting IASA's architecture frameworks with GSF's measurement standards like the Software Carbon Intensity specification, we're giving architects the tools to quantify impact and make sustainability decisions based on data, not guesswork. This collaboration helps us reach the decision-makers who can drive green software adoption at enterprise scale.
## Next Steps

Led by the SustainableArchitectures.org leadership team and representatives from the Green Software Foundation, the collaboration will be coordinated through designated executives from both organizations who will meet quarterly to align on priorities, track progress on shared initiatives, and ensure both communities benefit from collaborative resources and programs.

We invite technology professionals, sustainability leaders, architecture practitioners, and software engineers to engage in this global movement. Learn more or join the initiative at:
