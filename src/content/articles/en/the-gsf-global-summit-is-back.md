*Soon, you’ll step into a buzzing event space, hear the hum of conversations about energy demand, carbon intensity and software measurement. The room will be filled with faces—both familiar and new. There’s an energy that hits you like a cold wind, a shared purpose that draws you to the people around you. *

Now, imagine, along with you, hundreds of people get that same feeling when October comes around. 

Get ready for the 2024 GSF Global Summit—a series of in-person events hosted by GSF members between October 1 - 10. These gatherings will give you informative talks and panels—but they’ll do more than that, too. They’ll give you real connections. 

After two years, we’re excited to bring the Summit back to elevate our community, spark conversations, and drive the adoption of green software principles, patterns, and tools. Whether you’re looking to expand your knowledge, meet like-minded people, or be part of a global green software movement, a GSF Global Summit is calling you.
