          <strong>Data Security</strong>

        <p>
          We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions to protect the
          information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access,
          disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite
          our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100%
          security.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your
          passwords, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off
          after using a shared computer, choosing robust passwords that nobody
          else knows or can easily guess, not using a password for more than one
          site or service, and keeping your log-ins and passwords private. We
          are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or
          for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
          You must promptly notify us if you become aware that any information
          provided by or submitted to our Sites or through our Services is lost,
          stolen, or used without permission at privacy@jdfprojects.org.

          <strong>Retention of Your Personal Data</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We apply a general rule of keeping personal data only for as long as
          required to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected. However,
          in some circumstances, we may retain personal data for other periods
          of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance
          with legal, tax and accounting requirements, or if required to do so
          by a legal process, legal authority, or other governmental entity
          having authority to make the request, for so long as required. In
          specific circumstances, we may also retain your personal data for
          longer periods of time corresponding to a statute of limitation, so
          that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event
          of any complaints or challenges.

          <strong>International Transfers</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are located within the European Union (EU), you should note
          that your information will be transferred to the United States where
          JDFP is located. The U.S. is deemed by the European Union to have
          inadequate data protection. However, we have put in place European
          Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses which protect
          personal data transferred between JDFP and affiliated entities as well
          as The Linux Foundation, its managed service provider. In addition, if
          personal data is transferred to third party service providers located
          outside the European Union, we will take steps to ensure that your
          personal data receives the same level of protection as if it remained
          within the EU, including by entering into data transfer agreements, or
          using the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses.
          You have a right to obtain details of the mechanism under which your
          personal data is transferred outside of the EU by contacting
          gdpr@jdfprojects.org.

          collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of
          13 (or under the age of 14 for anyone living in Spain or South Korea),
          or knowingly allow such persons to register. If we become aware that
          we have collected personal information from a child under the relevant
          age without parental consent, we take steps to delete that
          information.

          <em>Effective date</em>

        <p>
          The websites of Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC and its
          projects (collectively, the "Sites") use cookies, in combination with
          pixels, local storage objects, and similar devices (collectively,
          "cookies" unless otherwise noted) to distinguish you from other users
          of the Sites. This helps us provide you with a good experience,
          improve our service, and personalize ads and content that may be
          delivered to you while you use the Sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          This cookie policy ("Cookie Policy") describes the types of the
          cookies we use on the Sites and our purposes for using them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have questions about this Cookie Policy, please contact us at
          privacy@jdfprojects.org. For a more complete description of the third
          party cookies that we currently use on the Sites, please see below.

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Your Consent</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You consent to placement of cookies on your computer by us and our
          third party service providers. Please read this Cookie Policy
          carefully for details about why we use cookies and the information

          <strong> </strong>
          If you do not wish to accept cookies in connection with your use of
          the Sites, you will need to delete, and block or disable cookies via
          your browser settings; see below for more information on how to do
          this. Please note that disabling cookies will affect the functionality
          of the Sites, and may prevent you from being able to access certain
          features on the Sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What Is a Cookie?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your
          browser or the hard drive of your computer. Unless you have adjusted
          your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will
          issue cookies as soon as you visit the Sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Key Concepts</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>First and third-party cookies</em></strong>
          : whether a cookie is 'first' or 'third' party refers to the domain
          placing the cookie.
        </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <em>First-party cookies</em>
            are those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the
            time (e.g., cookies placed by org).
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Third-party cookies</em>
            are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website
            being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another
            entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a
            third-party cookie.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Persistent cookies</em></strong>
          : these cookies remain on a user's device for the period of time
          specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user
          visits the website that created that particular cookie.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Session cookies</em></strong>
          : these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user
          during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens
          the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window.
          Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser,
          all session cookies are deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to Delete and Block our Cookies</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the
          browser settings. However, if you use your browser settings to block
          all cookies (including essential cookies), you may not be able to
          access all or parts of the Sites. Unless you have adjusted your
          browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue
          cookies as soon as you visit the Sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Changing your Cookie Settings. </em></strong>
          The browser settings for changing your cookies settings are usually
          found in the 'options' or 'preferences' menu of your internet browser.
          In order to understand these settings, the following links may be
          helpful. Otherwise you should use the 'Help' option in your internet
          browser for more details.

          <strong>What Cookies Do We Use and Why?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally the Sites use cookies to distinguish you from other users of
          the Sites. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when
          you browse the Sites and also allows us to improve them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cookies we may use on the Sites may be categorized as follows:
        </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Strictly necessary</li>
          <li>Performance</li>
          <li>Functionality</li>

          <strong><em>'Strictly Necessary'</em></strong>
